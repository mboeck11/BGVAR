\arguments{
\item{Data}{Either a \describe{
\item{\code{list object}}{ of length \code{N} that contains the data. Each element of the list refers to a country/entity. The number of columns (i.e., variables) in each country model can be different. The \code{T} rows (i.e., number of time observations), however, need to be the same for each country. Country and variable names are not allowed to contain a dot \code{.} (i.e., a dot) since this is our naming convention.}
\item{\code{matrix object}}{ of dimension \code{T} times \code{K}, with \code{K} denoting the sum of all endogenous variables of the system. The column names should consist of two parts, separated by a \code{.} (i.e., a dot). The first part should denote the country / entity name and the second part the name of the variable. Country and variable names are not allowed to contain a \code{.} (i.e., a dot).}
}}

\item{W}{An N times N weight matrix with 0 elements on the diagonal and row sums that sum up to unity or a list of weight matrices.}

\item{plag}{Number of lags used. Either a single value for domestic and weakly exogenous, or a vector of length two. Default set to \code{plag=1}.}

\item{draws}{Number of retained draws. Default set to \code{draws=5000}.}

\item{burnin}{Number of burn-ins. Default set to \code{burnin=5000}.}

\item{prior}{Either \code{SSVS} for the Stochastic Search Variable Selection prior, \code{MN} for the Minnesota prior, \code{NG} for the Normal-Gamma prior or \code{HS} for the Horseshoe prior. See Details below.}

\item{SV}{If set to \code{TRUE}, models are fitted with stochastic volatility using the \code{stochvol} package. Due to storage issues, not the whole history of the \code{T} variance covariance matrices are kept, only the median. Consequently, the \code{BGVAR} package shows only one set of impulse responses (with variance covariance matrix based on mean sample point volatilities) instead of \code{T} sets. Specify \code{SV=FALSE} to turn SV off.}

\item{hold.out}{Defines the hold-out sample. Default without hold-out sample, thus set to zero.}

      \item{\code{kappa0}}{ is the prior variance associated with the normal prior on the covariances if a covariance equals zero (spike, kappa0 should be close to zero).}
      \item{\code{kappa1}}{  is the prior variance associated with the normal prior on the covariances if a covariance is  unequal to zero (slab, kappa1 should be large).}

      }}
\item{"HS":}{ No additional hyperparameter needs to be elicited for the horseshoe prior.}
 }}

\item{eigen}{Set to TRUE if you want to compute the largest eigenvalue of the companion matrix for each posterior draw. If the modulus of the eigenvalue is significantly larger than unity, the model is unstable. Unstable draws exceeding an eigenvalue of one are then excluded. If \code{eigen} is set to a numeric value, then this corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue. The default is set to 1.05 (which excludes all posterior draws for which the eigenvalue of the companion matrix was larger than 1.05 in modulus).}

\item{Ex}{For including truly exogenous variables to the model. Either a \describe{
\item{\code{list object}}{ of maximum length \code{N} that contains the data. Each element of the list refers to a country/entity and has to match the country/entity names in \code{Data}. If no truly exogenous variables are added to the respective country/entity model, omit the entry. The \code{T} rows (i.e., number of time observations), however, need to be the same for each country.

\item{\code{OE.weights}}{ Default value is set to \code{NULL}. Can be used to provide information of how to handle additional country models (other entities). Additional country models can be used to endogenously determine variables that are (weakly) exogenous for the majority of the other country models. As examples, one could think of an additional oil price model (see also Mohaddes and Raissi 2019) or a model for the joint euro area monetary policy (see also Georgiadis 2015; Feldkircher, Gruber and Huber (2020)). The data for these additional country models has to be contained in \code{Data}. The number of additional country models is unlimited. Each list entry of \code{OE.weights} has to be named similar to the name of the additional country model contained in \code{Data}. Each slot of \code{OE.weight} has to contain the following information: \describe{
\item{\code{weights}}{ Vector of weights with names relating to the countries for which data should be aggregated. Can also relate to a subset of countries contained in the data.}
\item{\code{variables}}{ Vector of variables names that should be included in the additional country model. Variables that are not contained in the data slot of the extra country model are assumed to be weakly exogenous for the additional country model (aggregated with \code{weight}).}
\item{\code{exo}}{ Vector of variable names that should be fed into the other countries as (weakly) exogenous variables.}
}}
\item{\code{Wex.restr}}{ Character vector containing variables that should be excluded from being used as weakly exogenous from all unit models. An example that has often been used in the literature is to place these restrictions on nominal exchange rates. Default is \code{NULL} in which case all weakly exogenous variables are treated symmetrically.}
\item{\code{save.country.store}}{ If set to \code{TRUE} then function also returns the container of all draws of the individual country models. Significantly raises object size of output and default is thus set to \code{FALSE}.}
\item{\code{save.shrink.store}}{If set to \code{TRUE} the function also inspects posterior output of shrinkage coefficients. Default set to \code{FALSE}.}
\item{\code{save.vola.store}}{If set to \code{TRUE} the function also inspects posterior output of coefficients associated with the volatility process. Default set to \code{FALSE}.}
\item{\code{use_R}}{ Boolean whether estimation should fall back on \code{R} version, otherwise \code{Rcpp} version is used (default).}
\item{\code{applyfun}}{ In case \code{use_R=TRUE}, this allows for user-specific apply function, which has to have the same interface than \code{lapply}. If \code{cores=NULL} then \code{lapply} is used, if set to a numeric either \code{parallel::parLapply()} is used on Windows platforms and \code{parallel::mclapply()} on non-Windows platforms.}
\item{\code{cores}}{ Numeric specifying the number of cores which should be used, also \code{all} and \code{half} is possible. By default only one core is used.}

\item{\code{country.res}}{ is a matrix that contains the posterior mean of the  country models' residuals. The residuals have been obtained as a running mean and thus always relate to the full set of posterior draws. This implies that in case you have opted for trimming the draws the residuals do not correspond to the posterior draws of the "trimmed" coefficients. This is a storage problem, rather than a statistical problem. Experiments, however, show that residual properties (autocorrelation, cross-sectional correlation) of trimmed and reported residuals are close.}

\description{
Estimates a Bayesian GVAR with either the Stochastic Search Variable Selection (SSVS), the Minnesota prior (MN), the Normal-Gamma (NG), or the Horseshoe (HS) prior. All specifications can be estimated with stochastic volatility.
}
\details{
We provide three priors, the Minnesota labeled \code{MN}, the Stochastic Search Variable Selection prior labeled \code{SSVS} and the Normal-Gamma prior labeled \code{NG}. The first one has been implemented for global VARs in Feldkircher and Huber (2016) and the second one in Crespo Cuaresma et al. (2016), while the last one has been introduced to VAR modeling in Huber and Feldkircher (2019).
 Please consult these references for more details on the specification. In the following we will briefly explain the difference between the three priors. The Minnesota prior pushes the variables in the country-specific VAR towards their unconditional stationary mean, or toward a situation where there is at least one unit root present. The SSVS prior is a form of a 'spike' and 'slab' prior. Variable selection is based on the probability of assigning the corresponding regression coefficient to the 'slab' component. If a regression coefficient is non informative, the 'spike' component pushes the associated posterior estimate more strongly towards zero. Otherwise, the slab component resembles a non-informative prior that has little impact on the posterior. Following George et. al. (2008) we set the prior variances for the normal distribution in a semi-automatic fashion. This implies scaling the mixture normal with the OLS standard errors of the coefficients for the full model. The NG prior is a form of global-local shrinkage prior. Hence, the local component shrinks each coefficient towards zero if there is no information for the associated dependent variable. Otherwise, the prior exerts a fat-tail structure such that deviations from zero are possible. The global component is present for each lag, thus capturing the idea that higher lags should be shrunk more aggressively towards zero.
